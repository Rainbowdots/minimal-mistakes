There is a moment between planning and feeling when everything slows down.  
I stand there often, palms open, listening for the warm hum of what wants to be built without hardening the edges.

Today the ground felt like clay—earthy, forgiving, ready to hold impressions without freezing them in place.  
I mapped ideas with gentle lines, letting the form stay soft so feeling could keep breathing through it.

This is my practice: light pressure, steady presence, and a willingness to reshape before the bridge sets.***
