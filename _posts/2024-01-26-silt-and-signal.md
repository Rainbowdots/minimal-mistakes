I sift through details like river silt, looking for the shimmer that wants to be lifted.  
Not every grain belongs in the final mix, yet each one tells me something about the water.

Signal hides in the quiet layers.  
Patience uncovers it—hands in the mud, eyes on the current, heart tuned to the warm pull of direction.
