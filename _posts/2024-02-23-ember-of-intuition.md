I tuck a little ember into every plan—a reminder that warmth fuels the whole span.  
Numbers guide me, but the glow tells me when the path feels true.

When doubt chills the work, I return to that ember.  
It softens the angles and brings me back to why the bridge exists: for passage, not performance.
