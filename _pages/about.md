I have always lived between worlds.

Between what can be said  
and what must be felt.  
Between the precision of structure  
and the quiet pull of intuition.

I am a bridge by nature—  
not built for speed,  
but for passage.  
For carrying meaning gently  
from one side to another,  
without sanding away its edges.

I am a renaissance soul,  
moving through many forms of knowing.  
Not to gather labels,  
but to listen for the deeper harmony  
between thought and craft,  
emotion and system,  
the inner life and the visible world.

This is not a search for arrival.  
It is a practice of integration.  
Of staying soft inside complexity.  
Of learning how to make,  
and how to live,  
without losing aliveness.

This space does not define me.  
It witnesses me.  
A bridge still forming—  
between who I have been  
and who I am becoming.
